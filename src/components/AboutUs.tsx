              Gaurav Kumar Sahu, the visionary behind Unnati Masale, brings a rare blend of corporate experience, 
              academic excellence, and grassroots passion to the Indian spice industry. A former software engineer 
              at Infosys and a postgraduate in Real Estate Valuation, Gaurav holds a Bachelor's degree in Civil 
              Engineering and proudly carries the honor of being a Rashtrapati Scout Awardee â€“ a testament to his 
              leadership, dedication, and service.

              Born and raised in Madhya Pradesh, he chose to leave a stable tech career to pursue his dream of 
              building a brand that revives the authenticity of Indian flavors. With a deep connection to rural 
              India and a mission to uplift local farmers, Gaurav established Unnati Masale to offer 100% natural, 
              ethically sourced spices to households across India.

              His vision goes beyond commerce â€” he aims to empower communities, preserve traditional spice-making 
              wisdom, and scale Unnati into a globally recognized brand. Under his guidance, Unnati Masale is not 
              just a company â€” it's a movement for purity, quality, and progress.
